#binary search
#divide and conquer algorithm: Divding the big problem into sub problem and finding solutions
#problem : searching a particular element
#brute force algorithm: linear search
#        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
# arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
# key = int(11) #element which we have to find out #6
# flag = int(0) #indicator to find if the element exists or not #0
# left = int(0) #0  #4
# right = int(7) #7
# while(left != right):
#     mid = int((left+right)/2) #3   #5
#     if arr[mid] == key:
#         flag = 1
#         break
#     elif(arr[mid]<key):
#         left = mid+1
#     elif(arr[mid]>key):
#         right = mid-1

# if flag == 1:
#     print("element found")
# else:
#     print("element not found")

#searching algorithms
#linear search: going to each ad every element in a list {collection} to find the element
#binary search: divide by two over and over again

#binary search is always used in case of sorted arrays
#sort that array and then use binary search 


#sorting in python
#bubble sort
#quick sort
#merge sort

#homework: implement binary and linear search. 
#array of numbers, array of names in which you can find through first alphabet
#[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
#["anay" , "bs" , "patrick" , "susan"]
